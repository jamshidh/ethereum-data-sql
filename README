This repository is a library of common data structures for the ethereum haskell project.

Indexing recommendations:
Run psql eth while ethereumH is populating the database and

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON block_data_ref (block_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON block_data_ref (number);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON block_data_ref (hash);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON block_data_ref (parent_hash);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON block_data_ref (coinbase);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON address_state_ref (address);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON raw_transaction (from_address);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON raw_transaction (to_address);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON raw_transaction (block_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON raw_transaction (block_number);
