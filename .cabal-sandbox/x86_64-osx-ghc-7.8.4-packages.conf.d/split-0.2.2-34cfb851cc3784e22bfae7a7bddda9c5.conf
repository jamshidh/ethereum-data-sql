description: A collection of various methods for splitting
             lists into parts, akin to the \"split\" function
             found in several mainstream languages. Here is
             its tale:
             .
             Once upon a time the standard "Data.List" module
             held no function for splitting a list into parts
             according to a delimiter.  Many a brave
             lambda-knight strove to add such a function, but
             their striving was in vain, for Lo, the Supreme
             Council fell to bickering amongst themselves what
             was to be the essential nature of the One True
             Function which could cleave a list in twain (or
             thrain, or any required number of parts).
             .
             And thus came to pass the split package,
             comprising divers functions for splitting a list
             asunder, each according to its nature.  And the
             Supreme Council had no longer any grounds for
             argument, for the favored method of each was
             contained therein.
             .
             To get started, see the "Data.List.Split" module.
